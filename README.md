# first_name_rust_function
This function receive a String, and return part of this String until found a space (' '), for example: "hello world" return "hello"

I was reading the Rust's book, in the theme "The slice type" there's a code example but in my opinion is very confusing, then I made my own "first name" function without convert String to byte
